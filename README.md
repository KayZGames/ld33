It's the advent of idle and clicker games. The player clicks a few times, buys some upgrades and the game just
progresses over time, even while he is offline.

UNTIL NOW. You are the monster in an idle game and you get the chance to fight back!

Break his mouse, infect his auto clicker scripts, steal his gold and destroy his progress!

Raise his frustration until he doesn't want to play anymore and gives up!
